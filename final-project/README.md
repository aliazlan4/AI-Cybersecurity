# Final Project - AI & Cybersecurity

  

This folder contains python jypter files, dataset and saved model file of the final Project. There are two main python jupyter files present, their functionality is explained below:

1. Final_Project_Phishing_Website_Detection.ipynb
This file contains the code to process dataset, train model and then save it in H5 file format.

2. Final_Project_Detection_File.ipynb
This file can be used to test a new website phishing status using the model created by above file. For the time being, this file uses sample from the available dataset. But the sample can be changed to a real computed data vector of any website and test it with the saved model.
